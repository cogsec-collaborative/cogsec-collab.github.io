We worked together, creating common vocabulary, processes, and a mapping onto disinformation needs of information security tools, techniques and processes that included the AMITT standard for describing disinformation incidents and ways to mitigate and counter them.\nOne Community In January 2020, we merged into a single team: the Cognitive Security Collaborative(“Cogsec Collab”). We continued work on countering disinformation campaigns, with a focus on building the tools, processes, and networks needed to create an effective collective, distributed response to the large-scale, distributed, asymmetric threat that is modern disinformation. In short, we wanted to see if we could build a worldwide equivalent to the Baltic Elves by:\n making it possible to build response groups for free, sanely connecting together individual responses, connecting community alerts to responders, and connecting new response groups to the existing information security response system.  Our original goal was to focus on this work throughout 2020. We are working with NATO, RRM Canada, and other groups toward this end.\nActive Deployments In mid-March 2020, as COVID-19 disinformation incidents started to rise, we were asked to build a community-based disinformation team (similar to the crisis-mapping teams of the 2010s) to provide surge capacity in data gathering and initial analysis. In early April 2020 we were invited to lead the Disinformation team at the CTI League - a newly-formed community of cyber threat intelligence (CTI) experts, incident responders, and infosec industry experts working to neutralize cyber threats that exploit the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we pivoted from a focus on small-team management and Google Docs to building tools, process and structure for a group of 500 people representing information security, law enforcement, medical institutions, and ISP/media platforms. We’ve responded to dozens of incidents, ranging from medical scams to anti-lockdown protests.\nAs a result of this work, we are literally writing the book (“The Big Book of Disinformation Response”), on how to respond to disinformation at scale in real time. This is part of our goal to make processes and learnings available to other teams.\nTools In order to focus on building the tools needed by the disinfo response groups we are fostering, we’ve handed over the AMITT Framework to the MITRE Corporation, to be managed alongside ATT\u0026amp;CK, their signature information security framework. We’re using the modifications we made to STIX and MISP to build sharable rapid reports of disinformation incidents that include AMITT markups of tactics, techniques, and counters.\nWe’ve extended MISP and its companion case-tracking software TheHive, to make them easier to use for disinformation reporting by adding new case workflow templates, new social media objects, and code to scrape and upload those objects to MISP using a single Slack bot command.\nWith MISP repurposed to store disinformation, we launched the first MISP disinformation sharing community, bringing together a global network of researchers to share influence operation intelligence. The Cognitive Security Collaborative MISP disinformation community is included by default in the MISP community release: access to it is available on request.\nWe started building data collection and data science toolkits to make responses faster and easier. We continue to research and improve these core assets. We work with, learn from, and teach, a growing number of Threat Intelligence teams.\nThe Next 6 Months As the COVID-19 pandemic continues and new challenges emerge, we have set new goals for ourselves:\n build a network of teams capable of responding to threats, keep merging with the Threat Intelligence world, continue building out the discipline of disinformation response by writing comprehensive documentation on countermeasures, narrative arcs, and disinformation response, normalize the inclusion of disinformation response as the standard for the information security profession.  To further these goals, we have registered the Cognitive Security Collaborative as a non-profit organization and applied for 501(c)3 status in the United States. This gives us a legal entity to act as a long-term custodian of our shared tools and knowledge, as well as a financial conduit for shared infrastructure, hosting, and development grants.\n","date":1593475200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593475200,"objectID":"8012f3c624b634d72e517751418a7e32","permalink":"https://www.cogsec-collab.org/post/the-first-six-months/","publishdate":"2020-06-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/the-first-six-months/","section":"post","summary":"In 2019, the Misinfosec Slack group and Misinfosec Standards Working Group created bridges between the information operations, information security, data science and disinformation communities.","tags":["Disinformation","Information Operations","Cognitive Security","Cyber Security"],"title":"The Cognitive Security Collaborative: The First 6 Months","type":"post"},{"authors":["CogSecCollab"],"categories":[],"content":"       Download PDF\n","date":1592352000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592352000,"objectID":"b70d98b79bdb00664a3c035dfee80944","permalink":"https://www.cogsec-collab.org/post/right-wing-spotters-guide/","publishdate":"2020-06-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/right-wing-spotters-guide/","section":"post","summary":"We want everyone to be safe at the protests.

Cold War style soft power politics are being played, with nations making ostentatious displays of aid, or seizing medical supplies meant for others. This is the world stage, everyone is watching, and they will remember.\nRapidly changing geopolitical power dynamics, combined with troubled federal response, has allowed for Cold War style soft power plays within Western countries. This is no longer the purview of just nationstates: it’s everyone from plutocrats, oligarchs, hackers, online influencers and Etsy makers. On the nationstate level, Russia and China are donating aid to Italy, American states are competing with each other and negotiating directly with China for basic critical medical supplies. State governors are openly praising1 Chinese diplomats and plutocrats while the US government steals medical equipment from its own states, and the WHO first ignored2 Taiwan and then erased them (a deference to China that even the Washington Post3 has adopted). This sort of Cold War politicking used to happen in Lebanon or Somalia, now it\u0026rsquo;s happening in New York and Massachusetts.\n   Source: https://twitter.com/NYGovCuomo/status/1246457007214931968?s=20   How Did We Get Here? Online influence operations, including disinformation campaigns, changed the way that nationstates interact with each other (see Pablo Breuer\u0026rsquo;s work on the new instruments of national power, aka DIME models. Weakened nationstates like America that rely on power projection and had old unfixed fault lines across its population are particularly vulnerable; now we\u0026rsquo;re seeing nationstates moving in on the back of those campaigns, using aid the same way nations did during the Cold War, collecting allegiances and footholds whilst the last century\u0026rsquo;s big player is too distracted to play, mixing \u0026ldquo;hearts and minds\u0026rdquo; physical moves with influence to change the balance of the world.\nThere has to be a balance of power, or we\u0026rsquo;re all at the mercy of a handful of people halfway around the world. China plays the long game, Russia is opportunistic, and Europe is suffering another of a series of potentially Union busting crises.\nCollectively, we can handle these issues by getting ahead of other ongoing and future emergencies around the world such as PPE, food availability, and economic instability. We need to push back against influence operations and see and manage these as part of a larger whole.\nWe must also do what we can to mitigate the potential massive loss of life in less-equipped countries (makers - I hope you weren\u0026rsquo;t just designing for the US?) because it’s the right thing to do, and because providing medical equipment and PPE to other countries keeps them from becoming infection hotspots for the rest of the world.\nHow You Can Help In case you think that\u0026rsquo;s just words, hell no. Now’s your chance to step up.\nMakers, hackers, disinfo experts, data scientists, friends running mutual aid networks: we\u0026rsquo;re all part of a massive grassroots effort to connect up and help protect each country as best we can. Countries are territory. Countries are people. Countries are image and power projections. Whatever is happening at the top of each country, it\u0026rsquo;s never greater than the people underneath it.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s time to see and be seen.\n Data scientists: you can help with the \u0026ldquo;see\u0026rdquo;: when you see stories about milk being poured away, start mapping dairies, trucks, processing plants and transport routes - rinse, repeat for everything you see that looks \u0026lsquo;wrong\u0026rsquo;. Disinformation experts - understand that your role isn\u0026rsquo;t just to find the campaigns, but also to understand where the \u0026lsquo;good\u0026rsquo; information is, and amplify it through local and crisis teams. Makers - also think about whether your designs can be adapted for places with limited resources. Mutual aid people: think about your local information environments and whether you can improve them (there are still concerted efforts to damage local news environments with e.g. fake local news sites - you might be one of the few strong voices in your area).

We built infosec-based standards for describing and sharing information about disinformation incidents   The Misinfosec Working Group (“misinfosecWG”) is part of the Credibility Coalition. It was formed around a standard for action: we wanted a way for the many groups and individuals that we saw starting to investigate disinformation incidents to quickly share information about them, in the same ways that information security groups share information through information exchanges like ISACs and ISAOs, and disclosure schemes like bug bounties. We also wanted, as the field of disinformation response grew, to build ways for groups and individuals to quickly look up and share information about the mitigations and other activities that worked (or might work) to counter active disinformation campaigns.\nMisinfosecWG has come a long way since Pablo and I talked in 2018 about creating standards for misinfosec — the application of information security principles and practices to disinformation incident mitigation — and decided that CredCo was the only obvious place to incubate such a standards group. Walker and I started the CredCo misinfosec working group in December 2018, and since its official launch in January 2019, we’ve built a bridge between information security, misinformation and specialists in fields like narrative science (looking at you, John, Walker and Danielle), placed infosec-style response firmly inside disinformation response, and adapted existing infosec standards like ATT\u0026amp;CK and STIX into the AMITT standard for disinformation use, giving us the ability to transmit, share and analyze information about disinformation using existing information security technologies and techniques.\nAnd in November 2019, MisinfosecWG ran the second of its workshops; the “Blue Team Workshop” on misinformation countermeasures. The last of these, the “Red Team Workshop”, in Atlanta, modeled the tactics and techniques used by disinformation creators, and produced the AMITT framework of disinformation tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs). The DC workshop, held in the Atlantic Council’s meeting space, focused on how responders could mitigate and counter those TTPs.\nWhy Run a Countermeasures Workshop?    A STIX diagram for a disinformation incident. The workshop was about creating more of the green box on the right (courses of action to counter incidents, techniques, tactics etc)   MisinfosecWG has always had two main aims: to promote a more formal and rigorous classification of:\n Types of information-based attacks; and Types of defense from information-based attacks  We’d already covered the first bullet with our work on AMITT and STIX-based descriptions of disinformation TTPs. This workshop was all about our work on the second bullet: defense, and in particular, disinformation counters, mitigations and other potential responses.\nCountering disinformation is a multi-disciplinary activity, so we enlisted experts on disinformation, cognitive security, information security, narrative and rumor tracking, diplomacy, trust and safety, counterterrorism and CVE from our target user communities: industry, academia, media, community, government and military. We stated the workshop goals up front:\n Draft a disinformation “Blue Team” playbook. Its intended users are defenders, information security people and organizations; its contents should be a set of responses to misinformation attacks, with information on networks, response types, frameworks, examples. Ideate supporting an operational global Cognitive Security response network. The audience for this is potential response centre participants and leaders, and its contents should be a set of processes, methods, understanding needed to connect actors, partners, collaborators and funders.  And we framed the first solution space by combining the stages that a disinformation incident goes through (its “tactics”) from AMITT with the types of action that could block or mitigate each of them (courses of action categories) to create an empty ‘grid’ on the wall.\nOur aim in the workshop was to fill this grid with potential responses, then drill down into the details of some of those responses. First, level-setting. With all the different disciplines in the room, we used the AMITT framework and misinfosec pyramid (campaigns/ incidents/ narratives/ artefacts) to frame the work we were doing, including the idea that each object in the STIX graphs we create for each disinformation incident could potentially be paired with a course of action (the green icon, defined in information security as “an action taken to either prevent an attack or respond to an attack”) to mitigate, block or disable it, and that the ATT\u0026amp;CK idea of finding counters for each technique (the blue icons) was a good place to start.\nExisting Counters We didn’t go empty-handed to the workshop. The MisinfosecWG team had already spent time looking for counters in our set of example incidents (in the AMITT GitHub repository), and looking at existing counter examples and types through a combination of existing knowledge and literature search (e.g. in the DoJ’s framework). Some well-known examples we gave of these are below, but we also encouraged attendees to think laterally about countering the techniques that they saw:\n US Cyber Command blocking internet services to the Internet Research Agency on the day of the 2018 US Midterm elections Twitter killing a pro-Saudi botnet spreading Khashoggi disinformation tweets Macron’s team creating data honeypots before French elections CISA’s “War on Pineapple” education sheets about disinformation     AMITT Tactics and Techniques — see https://github.com/misinfosecproject/amitt_framework   We needed to frame these — to structure them so they weren’t a random collection of examples and suggestions. So we used AMITT’s TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures).\n   Courses of Action grid for AMITT tactics   AMITT breaks disinformation incidents down into tactic stages. In infosec, when you map those tactics against the types of action that could be taken against each tactic stage, you get a Courses of Action matrix.\nWe used the JP 3–13 (2006 US military Joint Publication 3–13 on information operations) definitions for our action categories; there are many of these, but we used the subset of Detect, Deny, Disrupt, Degrade, Deceive and Destroy, adding “Deter” to the list.\n Detect: discover or discern the existence, presence, or fact of an intrusion into information systems. Deny: prevent the adversary from accessing and using critical information, systems, and services. Disrupt: break or interrupt the flow of information. Degrade: reduce the effectiveness or efficiency of adversary command and control or communications systems, and information collection efforts or means. Deceive: cause a person to believe what is not true. military deception seeks to mislead adversary decision makers by manipulating their perception of reality. Destroy: damage a system or entity so badly that it cannot perform any function or be restored to a usable condition without being entirely rebuilt. Deter: discourage     SANS scale for counters   We also talked about counters in the context of the SANS scale from architectural through to offensive countermeasures.\nBrainstorming a Courses of Action wall    Courses of Action starting to fill up. Note the blank boxes in it, where we might need more work   And then it was post-its time. We split into groups, and each group took a set of tactic columns to work on, and a large stack of blank post-its. They didn’t disappoint. The wall filled up (the wall rows were courses of action; the columns were AMITT tactic stages).\nWe had a wide range of ideas back from the groups. Because we forced people to think about countering the whole disinformation lifecycle, from strategic planning all the way through to after-action evaluations, we think we captured counters that haven’t been tried before, many of which are in the valuable “left-of-boom” area before a campaign reaches the general public.\n   Course of Action box for “Detect” on tactic “Develop Content”   A post-it on a wall isn’t a response, so we asked teams to drill further into each set of counters — looking at who could take each action, how it might play out, what its side-effects might be. That produced a lot more detail, and yet more counters, all of which were added to a prototype technique-level playbook.\nThinking about End Users    ISACs — just some of the bodies connected to the Cognitive Security ISAO   Disinformation is a whole-system problem, and we took the opportunity to spend some time preparing for the next activity needed — coordinating whole-system response through bodies like the US ISAO system, and more specifically the prototype Cognitive Security ISAO, looking at what they do and how we as a group could support them.\nMaking Counters Useful    Counters organised by metatag — see https://github.com/misinfosecproject/amitt_counters   And then the workshop was done, but we’re not finished yet. We created a spreadsheet from the courses of action grid. After consolidating identical ideas, we have nearly 200 counters to analyze and make useful, plus suggested additions to AMITT etc.\nMisinfosecWG has finished its incubation year with CredCo, and the team has created and is now working in a new community, CogSec Collab, that’s concentrating on supporting disinformation volunteer groups and individuals.\nWe’re still organising the counters. We have them tagged with tactic, techniques, groups who could be write up in our responses. We grouped by ‘metatags’: tags for similar activities, til we realised that that was a proxy for a top-down activity and started describing that instead. We have two reports in the works: one on how we found and organised counters, and another on the counters themselves. Roger and Eric are busy adapting ATT\u0026amp;CK technologies to carry the AMITT responses and playbook entries that we’re building.

This is an extension of a decades-long struggle for “hearts and minds” via propaganda, influence operations and information warfare. Computational propaganda fueled by AI has the prospect of making matters much worse. The Credibility Coalition’s MisinfoSec Working Group (MisinfosecWG) is creating standards for sharing information about misinformation incidents and how to respond to them. The work of the group is inspired largely by existing standards in information security.\nThe structure and propagation patterns of misinformation attacks have many similarities to those seen in information security and computer hacking. By analyzing similarities with information security frameworks, MisinfosecWG gives defenders better ways to describe, identify and counter misinformation-based attacks. Specifically, we place misinformation components into a framework commonly used to describe information security incidents. Our work will give responders the ability to transfer other information security principles to the misinformation sphere, and to plan defenses and countermoves.","tags":["Misinfosec","AMITT","Disinformation"],"title":"Building Standards for Misinfosec","type":"publication"},{"authors":["SJ Terp"],"categories":[],"content":"Developing the AMITT (Adversarial Misinformation and Influence Tactics and Techniques) framework By John Gray and Sara-Jayne Terp\nOn May 24, 2019, the CredCo MisinfoSec Working Group met for the day at the Carter Center in as part of CredConX Atlanta. The purpose of the day was to draft a working MisinfoSec framework that incorporates the stages and techniques of misinformation, and the responses to it. We came up with a name for our framework: AMITT (Adversarial Misinformation and Influence Tactics and Techniques) provides a framework for understanding and responding to organized misinformation attacks based on existing information security principles.\nWe’d like to provide a recap of what the working group came up with the day, as well as explain and discuss some of the key concepts we used to inform our work. It should be noted that the working group relied on our previous work on the stages of misinformation, documented in a previous Misinfocon blog post.\nWho We Are and What We Do Before we describe what we accomplished at the Carter Center in Atlanta on May 24, it’s a good idea to briefly explain who we are and the formal mission of the MisinfoSec Working Group: The Credibility Coalition’s MisinfoSec Working Group (“MisinfoSec WG”) maps information security (infosec) principles onto misinformation. According to the The CredCo Misinfosec Working Group charter, our goal is to develop a tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) based framework that gives misinformation researchers and responders a common language to discuss and disrupt misinformation incidents.\nOur working group is also focused on contributing to the evolution of MisinfoSec as a discipline. This evolution is happening, as we’re seeing an emergence of presentations with slides referring to TTPs, and people starting to talk about building ISAOs (Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations) and ISACs (Information Sharing and Analysis Centers) — non-profit organizations that provide a coordinated central hub for gathering and sharing of cyber threat information for the US Government, specifically in relationship to misinformation.\nEstablishing a Common Language for Communicating Threats In order to coordinate misinformation response centers with each other, and share information easily, they’re going to need information-sharing standards for misinformation. So, a key goal of our working group is to promote more formal, practical and rigorous treatment of types of information-based attacks, and types of defense from information-based attacks. The working group’s deliverables will include a text resource consisting of definitions and a strawman framework combining the elements above, and an online article highlighting some common attacks in the wild.\nSo far, since January 2019, the group’s imperative has been to establish a common language for communicating about and responding to dynamic threats creating complex problems. It’s equally important to help lead the effort to ensure that MisinfoSec (applying information security paradigms to misinformation campaigns) plays a key role in every conversation about cognitive security and information system resilience.\nWhile we’re building upon existing definitions of the (mis)information ecosystem, the Misinfo Working Group is also working at evolving the language and discipline. Acknowledging that ‘credibility’ can be definitely be recognized and identified, and with an aim of providing more nuance to how coordinated misinformation is defined, [the following definitions](the following definitions) served as a foundation:\n Disinformation: False information that is deliberately created or disseminated with the express purpose to cause harm. Producers of disinformation typically have political, financial, psychological or social motivations.\n  Misinformation: Information that is false, but not necessarily intended to cause harm. For example, individuals who don’t know a piece of information is false may spread it on social media in an attempt to be helpful.\n  Malinformation: Genuine information that is shared to cause harm.This includes private or revealing information that is spread to harm a person or reputation.\n With these concepts and assumptions in mind, our working group operates according the definition of misinformation attack that we defined in Misinfosec: Applying Information Security Paradigms to Misinformation Campaigns (2019) by Christopher R. Walker, Sara-Jayne Terp and Pablo C. Breuer:\n We use ‘misinformation attack’ (and ‘misinformation campaign’) to refer to the deliberate promotion of false, misleading or mis-attributed information […] We are especially interested in misinformation designed to change beliefs in a large number of people.\nActors behind misinfo attacks include nation-states, institutional actors, grassroots trolls and financially-motivated freelancers. Common motives include geopolitical aims, issue-promotion or financial gain.\n Our Task in Atlanta: Building a MisinfoSec Framework So, on May, 25, the MisinfoSec Working Group assembled at CredConX in Atlanta to build a framework. The meeting room at the Carter Center was like our lab for the day. And, while our efforts were not in the league of Banting and Best whose discovery of insulin improved the lives of millions of people with diabetes, we found a striking parallel.\nTo use a metaphor, the problems plaguing today’s information ecosystem is like diabetes.\nAs Rand Waltzman and Renee DiResta have noted, “Disinformation is a not a problem that can be solved. It’s like a chronic disease that can be managed — not cured- allowing the afflicted to lead a moderately normal life.”\nAs we worked together at the Carter Center, on May 24, we were able to build upon the following our team’s existing work:\n  A strawman framework we created for the Web Conference MisInfoWorkshop2019 talk — not detailed, with a set of stages that were designed to be argued about. The paper is “Applying Information Security Paradigms to Misinformation Campaigns.” See our colleague Christopher Walker’s presentation here starting at the 1:00:00 mark.\n  A mapping of marketing, psyops and new misinformation stage models against the cyber killchain.\n  The misinformation pyramid, so we could talk about the different viewpoints of attackers (red team) and defenders (blue team)\n   Boucher’s list of techniques, mapped onto Ben Nimmo’s “5 D’s” strategies\n  An example of each of the stage-based frameworks we’d compared earlier in the day\n  A list of the existing ISACs (Information Sharing and Analysis Centers), so we remembered who we’re trying to support\n     Our meeting goal at the Carter Center in Atlanta was to build a framework of misinformation, stages, techniques and responses. In particular, the Working Group gathered to further solidify our work (since March 2019) on developing framework stages and technique templates for incident responders by:\n  Increasing our set of techniques\n  Mapping techniques to stages\n  Solidifying stage labels\n  Documenting potential technique responses\n  To do this, in Atlanta the Working Group came equipped with these common terms of reference:\n A technique: Deployed by Advanced Persistent Manipulators, can include relatively benign approaches, such as the use of humour and rhetoric, all the way through to the forging of documents or the use of false identities.\n  A stage-based model: Similar to the Cyber Kill Chain. We’ve previously outlined our premise about misinformation as a process of stages.\n  A response: There is no definitive collection of best-practices or playbook of successful counteractions. The MisinfoSec Working Group has defined a response as one step of a strategic process, a holistic one that starts with assessing a technique in the context of seeing it as part of a chain-of-events. With an evolving playbook we agree with Clint Watts’ current position that “the goal is to take an approach that will anticipate changes in threat behavior and proactively disrupt nefarious activity rather than reactively respond to it.”\n The First Task: Grouping Techniques for Spreading Misinformation Before the session, we prepared by listing the techniques used in each of our list of incidents, then created a post-it for each technique. Each technique post-it held an incident number and description, with techniques from incidents attributed to Russia documented on blue post-its, yellow post-its for non-Russia attribution. For the next step, we gathered all of the post-its, and then invited meeting attendees to cluster them into stages (pink post-it notes), and order the stages on a wall from left (campaign/incident planning) to right (campaign/incident completion). Mapping the wall was a process of grouping identical techniques into stacks, and talking through the stages, discussing what belonged where in the order.\n   Satisfied with this first exercise, we revisited our collection of existing models (ATT\u0026amp;CK model, marketing funnels, psyops, Department of Justice model), and models from Renée diResta, Ben Decker, Clint Watts and Bruce Schneier. We investigated whether their respective stages and techniques were represented in our model on the wall, and if not, added them. Surprises included that the stages in the New York Times model (used by Bruce Schneier) were actually techniques (more on this in a subsequent blog post). Having established a model, we needed to test it. We spent just over an hour adopting a “red team” (attacker) mindset in order to build an imaginary misinformation campaign. It was invaluable walking through each stage (see Sara-Jayne Terp’s Misinformation has stages blog post for more details) to see whether we’d missed anything.\n   No surprise, we had missed a few details, and so took the opportunity to add both stages and new techniques as we walked through the exercise.\nThe Next Task: Developing Techniques to Combat Misinformation With a tested model, after we transferred all of the information into a new spreadsheet, we were ready to dive into individual techniques. As part of this next stage of our work, we looked at techniques both individually and as part of a process, and we spent time thinking about how we could counter or disrupt them.\nGiven our time constraints, we focused on techniques that had amassed the most post-its during our previous exercise. More post-its meant the techniques were typically used in multiple incidents, such as fake Facebook group and Twitter bots and trolls.\nAt this stage, some additional discussions, which lead to useful pointers, included:\n Think in terms of feedback loops, rather than linear processes: While we might have a linear stage model, what we’re really observing are cycles and feedback loops (which is already built into ATT\u0026amp;CK Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge).\n  Look for both content and context: The network-building stage is about creating the context of a campaign; the content creation stage is about creating the content for it. These concepts both map nicely to our blue team idea of looking for both content and context.\n  Ask who is leading a misinformation campaign: We looked at how adversaries use metrics and measurement, and plan or deploy countermeasures. Is it implicit that there’s a “general manager” watching over the campaign, checking metrics and so on?\n  Understand different levels of defence: The working group looked at technique-level defence vs procedure-level defences (e.g. disrupting the chain of work), and doing that as far left in the stage diagram as possible. For example, we looked at how online or digital network building looks like a good location to disrupt, or getting inside the organisational places for doing both recon and delivering counters.\n    Don’t Forget the Boom! And, during the day at the Carter Center, we didn’t forget the “boom,” a term borrowed from the military meaning the moment before a bomb explodes (as opposed to “right-of-boom”, which comes after). In particular we’re very interested in working towards the disruption, denial and displacement of the left-of-boom techniques.\nWhat’s Next for CredCo’s MisinfoSec WG By the end of our working session at CredConX at the Carter Center in Atlanta on May 24, we successfully created AMITT (Adversarial Misinformation and Influence Tactics and Techniques), a preliminary MisinfoSec framework that included stages, techniques and responses. Next, the working group needs to test it with different demographics, continue the counter-discussions and support the new ISAOs as they come online. As well, stay tuned for our June report — our goal is to have Version 1.0 online by the end of July.\nParticipants at the May 24 session in Atlanta included Sara-Jayne Terp, Christopher Walker, John Gray, Courtney Crooks, Chau Tong and Renee DiResta. Working group member Pablo Breuer was absent for the day. Many thanks to them and to our guests — Amy Bruckman, Benn Konsynski, Richard Foard, David Carroll, Michael Best, Nitin Agarwal and Tanushree Mitra — for their thoughts and input.\n","date":1563494400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563494400,"objectID":"b4894524db3810e612fbc26ab892b1bd","permalink":"https://www.cogsec-collab.org/post/misinfosecwg-framework-takes-shape/","publishdate":"2019-07-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/misinfosecwg-framework-takes-shape/","section":"post","summary":"Developing the AMITT (Adversarial Misinformation and Influence Tactics and Techniques) framework By John Gray and Sara-Jayne Terp\nOn May 24, 2019, the CredCo MisinfoSec Working Group met for the day at the Carter Center in as part of CredConX Atlanta.
