- We help bootstrap **Disinformation Response Organizations** (DROs) to form their structure, communications, and infrastructure.
- Manage and/or mentor DROs that are responding to disinformation in various ways.
- Build and adapt opensource tools and processes to counter disinformation.
- Train DROs in their use.

Some of the Communities we support:

- [CTI League](https://cti-league.com/)
- [Reality Team](https://realityteam.org/)
- COVID-19 Disinfo
- COVID-19 Activation
