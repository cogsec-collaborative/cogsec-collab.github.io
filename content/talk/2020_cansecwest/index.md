summary: Status update on the state of counter disinformation playbooks.

abstract: "There are now three main layers of security to consider: cyber, physical and cognitive. Cognitive security includes tracking and countering disinformation, misinformation and other information operations. <br><br>In this talk, we show the frameworks weâ€™ve built for rapidly sharing information about disinformation campaigns and their counters, including AMITT, the disinformation extension to the ATT&CK framework, how to connect incident-level information to data science artefacts using a disinformation extension to STIX, and the tactic- and technique-level disinformation mitigations and counters that become possible when you think about disinformation incidents as a structured information security problem."
