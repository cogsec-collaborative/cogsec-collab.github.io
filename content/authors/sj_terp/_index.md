SJ builds frameworks to improve how autonomous systems and human communities work together. Fusing her work as a data scientist and information security expert, she is examining the light and dark sides of the human-AI interface: building algorithms that enable autonomous systems to accelerate the creation of shared situational awareness in crises; and applying information security principles to counter the impact of misinformation and disinformation campaigns on human systems. 

She runs Bodacea Light Industries, is a senior advisor at the Atlantic Council, and chairs the Cognitive Security CoLab. Previously she has taught data science at Columbia University, served as CTO of UN Global Pulse (the UNâ€™s big data initiative), and designed machine learning algorithms and unmanned vehicle systems at the UK Ministry of Defence. SJ holds degrees in AI and neural networks.
